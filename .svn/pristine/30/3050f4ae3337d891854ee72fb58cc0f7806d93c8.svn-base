AlarmSequenceNumber ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  STATUS current
  DESCRIPTION
  "Identifies a notification generated by enodeB.
   EnodeB includes this number in each notification it generates.
   Each time enodeB generates an alarm-notification it increments this number.
   Its purpose is to help EMS in detecting of loss of notifications.
   For instance, if EMS receives alarmSequenceNumber = 43
   and the previously received alarmSequenceNumber = 40,
   it means 2 notifications were lost (#41 and #42) in transport.

   The first notification starts with 1.
   Value 0 is reserved.
   This number increments monotonically till it wraps around.
   At wrap around, the next notification uses value 1.
   When ENB restarts, this value is reset (to 1).
