           "[Parameter_Description :
             Allows operator to start and stop message tracing in eNodeB.
             The 'duration' field indicates the period for which traces should be collected.
             eNodeB starts collecting the trace after receiving this command and continues to collect for 'duration' minutes.
             At end of 'duration', eNodeB stops the trace and eNode generates an alarm. The alarm contains the trace-file name.
             
The objects to be traced are configured in TraceConfig Table.
             Traces are collected in a single-file in eNodeB.
             Trace is a command; it does not persist across reboot, restart, activation.
             
Operator can stop an ongoing trace by sending stopTrace command. The 'duration' field in stopTrace command is 'dont care' i.e. ignored by eNodeB.]"
